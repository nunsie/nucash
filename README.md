## Motivation

I started this project out of a new found interest in my personal finances.

I could not find any free, simple, easy to use, offline storage with online transaction syncing accounting software. Most of the options out there cost way too much, try to do more than I really care for and aren't really user friendly.

GnuCash came really close, but I quickly ran into a few issues:

- Unable to easily import financial statements from my bank, brokers and crypto exchanges.
- No support for crypto currencies.
- Unable to sync price feeds for stock and currency quotes.
- Lots of crashes.
- Reporting is pretty basic and bland.
- UI is pretty dated.

I don't hate it, I just think it could be better.

Additionally, I've been meaning to learn Rust for a long time now and I thought this would be the perfect way to scratch that itch and take the plunge.
